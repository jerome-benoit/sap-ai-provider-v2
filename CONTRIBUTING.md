## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Git
- SAP AI Core service key (for testing with real API)

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sap-ai-provider.git
   cd sap-ai-provider
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install  # or npm ci if package-lock.json exists
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (optional, for testing)

   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   cp .env.example .env

   # Edit .env and add your AICORE_SERVICE_KEY
   ```

4. **Verify installation**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

### Development Workflow

Our development workflow follows these steps:

1. **Make your changes** in `/src` directory
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
   - Keep components focused and single-purpose

2. **Run type checking**

   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

3. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   npm test              # Run all tests
   npm run test:node     # Node.js environment
   npm run test:edge     # Edge runtime environment
   npm run test:watch    # Watch mode for development
   ```

4. **Check code formatting**

   ```bash
   npm run prettier-check  # Check formatting
   npm run prettier-fix    # Auto-fix formatting
   ```

5. **Lint your code**

   ```bash
   npm run lint           # Check for issues
   npm run lint-fix       # Auto-fix issues
   ```

6. **Build the library**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run check-build    # Verify outputs
   ```

7. **Test with examples** (requires SAP credentials)

   ```bash
   npx tsx examples/example-generate-text.ts
   ```

### Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing, ensure ALL of these pass:

```bash
npm run type-check && \
npm run test && \
npm run test:node && \
npm run test:edge && \
npm run prettier-check && \
npm run lint && \
npm run build && \
npm run check-build
```

This validation takes approximately 15 seconds and ensures CI will pass.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** - Update README.md, API_REFERENCE.md, or other docs
   if you've changed the API
2. **Follow commit conventions** - Use
   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `test:` for test additions/changes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
3. **Add tests** - All new features and bug fixes must include tests
4. **Request review** - The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at
   least one maintainer

### Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (0.x.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, backwards compatible

Version bumping is handled by maintainers during release process.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Add JSDoc comments to all public APIs
- Export types that are part of public API
- Use `zod` schemas for runtime validation

### Code Style

- 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Test both Node.js and Edge runtime environments
- Use descriptive test names
- Cover error cases and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Error Handling

- Use Vercel AI SDK standard errors (`APICallError`, `LoadAPIKeyError`, `NoSuchModelError`)
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Include debugging context (request IDs, locations)
- Follow existing error patterns

### Documentation

- JSDoc comments for all public functions, classes, and interfaces
- Include `@example` blocks for complex APIs
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update API_REFERENCE.md for API changes
- Keep documentation concise and precise

#### Documentation Guidelines

When adding new features or changing APIs, follow these guidelines to maintain
documentation quality:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->

**1. Single Source of Truth**

Each piece of information should have ONE authoritative location:

- **API details** → `API_REFERENCE.md`
- **Setup instructions** → `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
- **Error solutions** → `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- **Architecture decisions** → `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Breaking changes** → `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Quick start** → `README.md` (with links to detailed docs)

**2. Avoid Duplication**

When referencing information from another doc, use links instead of copying:

```markdown
<!-- ❌ BAD: Duplicating content -->

To set up authentication, create a service key in SAP BTP...

<!-- ✅ GOOD: Linking to source of truth -->

See [Environment Setup Guide](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md#authentication) for
authentication setup.
```

**3. Update Checklist for New Features**

- [ ] Add to `API_REFERENCE.md` with TypeScript signatures and examples
- [ ] Update `README.md` if user-facing (keep concise, link to API_REFERENCE)
- [ ] Create example in `examples/` directory if significant feature
- [ ] Update `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` if breaking change
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to ensure TypeScript compiles

**4. Example Code Guidelines**

- Use relative imports (`../src/index`) for repo examples
- Add comment explaining production import path:

  ```typescript
  // NOTE: This example uses relative imports for local development
  // In your project, use: import { ... } from "@jerome-benoit/sap-ai-provider"
  ```

**5. Documentation Verification**

Before submitting a PR, run:

```bash
npm run build         # Ensures TypeScript compiles
npm test             # Runs test suite
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Located in `*.test.ts` files alongside source
- Use Vitest as test framework
- Mock SAP AI SDK calls for offline testing
- Test both success and error paths

### Integration Tests

- Test actual integration with SAP AI SDK
- Require `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY` to run
- Can be skipped in CI if credentials not available

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Focus on critical paths and error handling
- Don't test trivial getters/setters

## Architecture Guidelines

### Provider Integration

- Implement Vercel AI SDK interfaces correctly
- Follow the separation: provider factory → language model
- Maintain compatibility with Node.js and Edge runtimes
- Use existing authentication patterns

### Performance

- Streaming responses must be efficient
- Avoid blocking operations in request/response flow
- Consider memory usage for large responses
- Use caching where appropriate

### Security

- Never expose service keys or tokens in logs
- Validate all external inputs with zod schemas
- Follow secure credential handling patterns
- Check for injection vulnerabilities
